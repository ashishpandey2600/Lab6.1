Lab Practice 6 1D &2D Array
1-D Array (Any Five Programs with output)
1. WAP to find sum of all the elements in an array. 2. WAP to sort an array.
3. WAP to sort an array and then find median.
4. WAP to find greatest element in an array.
5. WAP to sort and merge two arrays and store it into third array.
6. WAP to read an array then change the array such that its nth value contains the sum of previous n-1 elements.
7. WAP to read an array and insert 0 between every two elements of the array.
8. WAP to read an array and store it. Now change the array by putting the resultant of subtraction of two elements between them.
2-D Array (Any Five Programs with output)
9. WAP to read and write a 2-D array.
10. WAP to transpose a matrix.
11. WAP to check whether matrices are symmetric or not.
12. WAP to find determinant of a matrix.
13. Write a program to input a square matrix M1 and create another matrix M2 with same dimensions and such that the addition of every row of M1 is stored in the corresponding diagonal element of M2.
i.e., the addition of row 0 of M1 will be stored in the element M2(0, 0), addition of
row 1 of M1 will be stored in the element M2(1,1) and so on. Make the other elements
of M2 zero.
14. Write a program to input two matrices from the user. Perform the following functions on the matrices:
a) Addition.
b) Subtraction.
c) Multiplication.
Make the program menu driven with appropriate error handling.
